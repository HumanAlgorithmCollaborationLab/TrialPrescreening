# Trial Prescreening

This repository contains documentation and resources related to the trial prescreening process.

## How to Use

1. **System Requirements**  
   - All analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.0. No additional software dependencies or non-standard hardware were required. The code has been tested and confirmed to run on systems with R 4.3.0 installed.
   
2. **Installation Guide**  
   - To replicate the analysis, install R version 4.3.0 from https://cran.r-project.org. Once R is installed, open an R session and install any required packages using install.packages(). Installation on a standard desktop computer with an internet connection typically takes less than 15 minutes, including downloading R and installing any necessary packages.

3. **Demo**  
   - The R code files and project data are found in the project Github (https://github.com/HumanAlgorithmCollaborationLab/TrialPrescreening/tree/main). The code file Analytic_Data_Creation needs to be run first, which generates analytic data used in the statistical analyses. These analyses are in separate, standalone R scripts that output results found in the manuscript. After downloading the code and data files, the R scripts have a runtime of less than 5 minutes on a standard desktop computer.

4. **Instructions for Use**  
   - Users should download the code and data files as is from the project Github, maintaining file structure. Then users will run the R script Analytic_Data_Creation to generate analytic data from raw data. Other R scripts can be run afterwards to produce standalone analysis results (i.e. the primary accuracy outcome).
